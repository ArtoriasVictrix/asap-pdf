# Pug-lint

For [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) (formerly Jade) linting, ASAP PDF uses [pug-lint](https://github.com/pugjs/pug-lint). All pug-lint
settings are stored in the ASAP PDF root directory in the `.pug-lintrc` file. You can change these settings as needed
and agreed upon by your team.

## Pre-commit hook

Pug-lint is run automatically on pre-commit ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)):

```
"husky": {
	"hooks": {
		"pre-commit": "lint-staged"
	}
},
"lint-staged": {
	...
	"./app/pug/**/*.pug": [
		"pug-lint"
	]
}
```

## Setting up VS Code

To ensure VS Code highlights errors in Pug files as specified in the `.pug-lintrc` linter settings file, install the
[puglint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrmlnc.vscode-puglint) plugin and change settings in the
`.vscode/settings.json` file:

Windows: `File → Preferences → Settings`

macOS: `Code → Preferences → Settings`

Press `Open Settings (JSON)`:

And paste the following code snippet:

```
{
	"puglint.enable": true
}
```
