# Utilities API

You can see how the Utility API works on the [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/).

ASAP PDF's approach to API utilities differs from Bootstrap in the following ways:
- support for responsiveness is removed;
- the name of some utilities has been changed (the full list of utilities is located in the `/app/scss/utilities/_utilities.scss` file);
- the `create-range()` function has been added.

## create-range()

The `create-range()` function allows you to create maps
([associative arrays](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps)) based on specified parameters:

1. the opening value of the range;
2. the ending value of the range;
3. range step;
4. postfix for the class name (determined by value type).

For example, `create-range(4, 24, 4, '%')` will return the following associative array:

```
(
	4p: 4%,
	8p: 8%,
	12p: 12%,
	16p: 16%,
	20p: 20%,
	24p: 24%
)
```

The purpose of this function is to eliminate the need to manually input all of the values for a given value range (for
example, to create the `mb-0` - `mb-44` utilities).

The `create-range()` function is located in the `/app/scss/_functions.scss file`.
