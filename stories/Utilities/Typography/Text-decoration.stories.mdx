# Text decoration

Decorate text in components with text decoration classes.

<Canvas>
<div>
	<p class="underline">This text has a line underneath it.</p>
	<p class="line-through">This text has a line going through it.</p>
	<a href="#" class="no-underline">This link has its text decoration removed</a>
</div>
</Canvas>

## SCSS (Sass)

### Utilities API

Text decoration utilities are declared in the utilities API in `app/scss/_utilities.scss`.
[Learn how to use the utilities API on the Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/#using-the-api).

```
// Text decoration
'text-decoration': (
	property: text-decoration,
	class: null,
	values: (
		'underline': underline,
		'line-through': line-through,
		'no-underline': none,
	),
),
