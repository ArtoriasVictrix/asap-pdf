# ðŸš€ Install and Launch

1. Download the [ASAP PDF repository](https://github.com/ArtoriasVictrix/asap-pdf);
2. Run `npm i` in the root folder of the repository;
3. Run `npm start` or `npm run dev` (depending on the
[build mode](?path=/story/get-started-project-settings--page#about-build-modes) you need).

The following commands should be enough for daily tasks:

To run the `npm test` script, you need to [install the Poppler library](?path=/story/get-started-install-poppler--page);

> In ASAP PDF, **pdf2img testing** involves converting PDFs to images while
> keeping the pages divided. The resulting images are then compared with the
> golden ones. You can learn more about testing in ASAP PDF by going to the
> ["About testing"](?path=/story/test-about--page) page.

> If you are using data mocking, running the project with the
> `npm run prod:mock-pdf` command is the recommended option for testing. This
> way, you will get information about the project status in greater detail.

Builds and tests can be customized. You can learn about the settings here:
1. [Project settings](?path=/story/get-started-project-settings--page);
2. [Test settings](?path=/story/test-settings--page).

Check a detailed description of other scripts on the
[npm scripts](?path=/story/get-started-npm-scripts--page) page.
