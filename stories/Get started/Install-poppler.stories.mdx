# ðŸš€ Install Poppler

## Linux

Linux users need to download `poppler-data` and `poppler-utils` binaries.
Binaries installation on Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install poppler-data
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

## macOS/Darwin

You can install poppler binaries on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install poppler
```

## Windows

Windows users can install poppler by following these steps:

1. Go to [this page](https://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/) and download the binary of your choice. In this
example we will download and use `poppler-0.68.0_x86`;
2. Extract the archive file `poppler-0.68.0_x86.7z` into `C:\Program Files`. Thus, the directory structure should look
something like this:

```
C:
â”” Program Files
  â”” poppler-0.68.0_x86
    â”œ bin
    â”œ include
    â”œ lib
    â”” share
```

3. Add `C:\Program Files\poppler-0.68.0_x86\bin` to your system `PATH` by doing the following: Click on the Windows
start button, search for `Edit the system environment variables`, click on `Environment Variables...`, under
`System variables`, look for and double-click on `PATH`, click on `New`, then add
`C:\Users\Program Files\poppler-0.68.0_x86\bin`, click `OK`.
4. If you are using a terminal to execute poppler (e.g. running `pdf2image` in command line), you may need to reopen
your terminal for poppler to work.
5. Done!
