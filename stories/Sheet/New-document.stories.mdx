# Create a New Document

> ASAP PDF provides support for both Pug and HTML file formats. Please note that all resulting documents are stored in
> the `/dist/` directory. Therefore, it is crucial that the names of the HTML and Pug pages do not match, as this will
> overwrite files during the copying process to `/dist/`. For example: `/app/pug/pages/example.pug` and
> `/app/html/example.html` (one of them will overwrite the other).


## HTML

All pages are located in the `/app/html/` folder. To create a new page, copy any of the existing pages or create a new
HTML file and paste the following code into it:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" data-theme="asap">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	<title>Example</title>
</head>

<body>
	<div class="sheet A4-m-15mm">
		<h1 class="h1">
			Example
		</h1>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```

This will create an **A4** size page with a **15mm margin** on each side.

Now you can fill the document with a markup, although this must be done inside the block containing the `A4-m-15mm sheet` classes;

You can read about page sizes and creating custom sizes [here](?path=/story/sheet-sheet--page).


## Pug (Jade)

All pages are located in the `/app/pug/pages/` folder. To create a new page, copy any of the existing pages or create a
pug file and paste the following code into it:

```pug
//- Path to main document template
extends ./../templates/common

//- Document variables
block append vars
	-
		let docTitle = 'Example' //- <title>

//- Document styles (if you need to include separate style files)
block appStyles
	//- link(href='libs/example.css' rel='stylesheet')


//- Document content
block append content
	.sheet.A4-15mm
		//- Sheet content
		p Example
```

This will create an A4 size page with a 15mm margin on each side.

Now you can fill the document with markup, although this must be done inside the block containing `.sheet.A4-m-15mm`;

You can read about page sizes and creating custom sizes [here](?path=/story/sheet-sheet--page).


## SCSS

You can create separate style files for new pages:
- create a new SCSS file in the `/app/scss/pages/` folder;
- include this file in `/app/scss/_pages.scss`.

Here is an example of including the page style file example.scss in the `/app/scss/_pages.scss` file:

```
// ===============================================
// PROJECT PAGES
// ===============================================


@import 'pages/example';
```
