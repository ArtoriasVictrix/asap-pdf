# Themes

## SCSS

Theming in ASAP PDF is implemented using CSS variables
([CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)).

Style files accountable for the theme (font sizes, colors, theme variables for components) are stored in the 
`/app/scss/variables/themes/{theme-name}/` folder. These files are connected to one common theme SCSS file
`/app/scss/variables/themes/{theme-name}.scss`, which, in turn, is connected to the file for all themes
`/app/scss/_themes.scss`.

```
app
└ scss
  ├ _themes.scss
  └ variables
    └ themes
      ├ {theme-name}.scss
      └ {theme-name}
```

In theme files, CSS variables are bound to the `:root[data-theme='theme-name']` selector. Example: (file
`/app/scss/variables/themes/asap/_bg.scss`):

```SCSS
:root[data-theme='asap'] {

	--bg-white: var(--cl-white);
	--bg-black: var(--cl-black);
	--bg-light: var(--cl-gray-700);
	--bg-dark: var(--cl-gray-100);
	--bg-primary: var(--cl-blue-600);
	--bg-success: var(--cl-green-600);
	--bg-warning: var(--cl-orange-600);
	--bg-danger: var(--cl-red-600);
	--bg-info: var(--cl-yellow-600);

}
```

By this means, these variables will apply to a document that has its `data-theme` attribute set to `asap` in the
`<html>` tag.


## HTML

The `app/html/` folder contains examples of completed documents that you can use to create your own. The default theme
in them is `asap`. This value can be changed in the `data-theme` attribute in the `<html>` tag:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" data-theme="asap">
...
```

> You can choose any theme for each separate file in the `app/html/` folder.


## Pug

ASAP PDF has the `asap` theme selected by default. This value can be changed in the `/app/pug/templates/common.pug`
file:

```
...

doctype html
html(lang='en' data-theme=theme ? theme : 'asap')

...
```

You can set the theme of your choice for each separate document. To do this, create a theme variable in the document
file and assign the name of the desired theme. Example (`/app/pug/pages/index.pug`):

```Pug
//- Document variables
block append vars
	-
		let theme = 'dark'
```

If you have multiple pages with a theme other than the default one in the `common.pug` file, you can create a copy of
the `common.pug` file and use it as the main template for new pages. For example:

```
//-
	1. Create a copy of the 'common.pug' file and name it 'common-dark.pug', for example;
	2. In the 'common-dark.pug' file, change the value of the 'data-theme' attribute to 'dark' :
...

doctype html
html(lang='en' data-theme=theme ? theme : 'dark')

...

-----------------------

//-
	3. In your document file (create a copy of the app/pug/pages/index.pug file and name it as required), change the
	path to the main document template from 'common' to 'common-dark':

extends ./../templates/common-dark

...
```
