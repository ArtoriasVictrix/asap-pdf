# Clearfix

> Quickly and easily clear floated content within a container by adding a clearfix utility.

Easily clear `float`s by adding `.clearfix` **to the parent element**. Can also be used as a mixin.

Use in Pug:

```scss
.clearfix ...
```

The mixin source code:

```scss
@mixin clearfix() {
	&::after {
		display: block;
		clear: both;
		content: '';
	}
}
```

Use the mixin in SCSS:

```scss
.element {
	@include clearfix;
}
```

The following example shows how the clearfix can be used. Without the clearfix the wrapping div would not span around
the buttons which would cause a broken layout.

<Canvas>
<div class="bg-info clearfix">
	<div class="bg-light p-12 float-left">Example Button floated left</div>
	<div class="bg-light p-12 float-right">Example Button floated right</div>
</div>
</Canvas>
